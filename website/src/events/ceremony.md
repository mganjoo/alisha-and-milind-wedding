The festitivites begin with the _baraat_, or wedding procession, which is
Milind’s ~grand~ entrance to the ceremony. Guests will meet at the hotel’s
entrance and then will be guided to the starting point for the baraat.
Alisha’s family will greet Milind’s family for the _milni_ ceremony, marked
by the exchange of garlands.

Following this, guests are invited to the Courtyard for the Hindu wedding
ceremony &mdash; this is the part where Alisha and Milind actually get
married! Light refreshments will be provided when guests arrive at the
Courtyard, with lunch immediately following the ceremony at the Engage
Ballroom.
