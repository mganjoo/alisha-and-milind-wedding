The festitivites begin with the _baraat_, or wedding procession, which is
Milind’s ~grand~ entrance to the ceremony featuring lively music and dance. Guests
will meet at the hotel’s entrance and then will be guided to the starting
point for the baraat. Alisha’s family will greet Milind’s family for the
_milni_ ceremony, with the exchange of garlands.

Following the milni, guests are invited to the Courtyard for the Hindu
wedding ceremony &mdash; this is when Alisha and Milind actually get married!
Light refreshments will be provided as guests arrive at the Courtyard, with
lunch following the ceremony at the Engage Ballroom.
