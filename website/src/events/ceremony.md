We are off to an early start! Grab some coffee and light refreshments that will be awaiting you at the meeting spot for the _baraat_, or wedding procession. The baraat will be followed by the _milni_ ceremony, where Alisha’s family will greet Milind’s family. The indoor religious ceremony will then commence, followed by lunch.
