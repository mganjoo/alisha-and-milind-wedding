We are off to an early start! We will meet at the Palms Tower parking lot (circle 45 on [this map](https://bit.ly/3kqL79A)) for the _baraat_, or wedding procession. The baraat will be followed by the _milni_ ceremony, where Alisha’s family will greet Milind’s family. The indoor religious ceremony will then commence, followed by lunch.
