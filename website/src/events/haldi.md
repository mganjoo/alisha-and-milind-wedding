We would love for you to join us at the Saxena residence, where Alisha and Milindâ€™s family and friends will apply a paste of _haldi_ or turmeric on both of them as part of this auspicious pre-wedding event in the morning. Lunch will be served after the haldi.

Alisha will then have her bridal _mehndi_ applied on her hands and feet. We will enjoy music, dancing, and each other&rsquo;s company throughout this time, so please feel free to stay for the entire mehndi, or come and go as you like throughout the day! We will serve dinner in the evening.
