We would love for you to join us at the Saxena home, where Alisha and Milind&rsquo;s family and friends will apply a paste of _haldi_ or turmeric on both of them as part of this auspicious pre-wedding event in the morning. Lunch will be served after the haldi.

Alisha will then have her bridal _mehndi_ applied on her hands and feet.
