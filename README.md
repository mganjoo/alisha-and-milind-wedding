[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7b8c6a26-ba68-4d43-8588-64f155b15c47/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/winning-lamport-6a6661/deploys)

[![This project is using Percy.io for visual regression testing.](https://percy.io/static/images/percy-badge.svg)](https://percy.io/Milind-Ganjoo/alisha-and-milind-wedding-e2e)

## üõ† Getting started

1.  **Check out the repository and install dependencies.**

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:mganjoo/alisha-and-milind-wedding.git
    cd alisha-and-milind-wedding/
    npm run bootstrap:ci
    ```

1.  **Add Firebase credentials.**

    Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings and scroll down to find the
    section listing key app credentials. Create files `.env.development` and
    `.env.production` (they will be ignored by Git) in the `website/` directory
    of the project, with the following contents:

    ```sh
    GATSBY_FIREBASE_API_KEY="<apiKey from Firebase>"
    GATSBY_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="<authDomain from Firebase>"
    GATSBY_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="<projectId from Firebase>"
    ```

    **Note**: you might also want to add configuration variables for the build
    and test stage of the project. See
    [Configuration environment variables](#configuration-environment-variables)
    for available options.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Build website continuously:

    ```sh
    npm run start:website
    ```

1.  **Start editing.**

    The site will be running at `http://localhost:8000`, and the GraphiQL tool
    will be at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.

### CSS Modules typings

This project uses
[CSS Modules](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/css-modules/) within
Gatsby for some components. To ensure typings are generated for these files, run
`npm run generate:csstypes` from within the `website/` folder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Netlify configuration environment variables

These options control how the Gatsby site gets generated. These options should
only be set on Netlify in staging and production environments, never in CI or
test environments.

- `DISABLE_DEMO_PAGES`: When set to `"1"`, disables building any demo pages in
  `pages-demo/`.
- `GATSBY_DISABLE_FULL_SITE`: When set to `"1"`, disables display of the full
  website.
- `GA_TRACKING_ID`: Tracking code for Google Analytics. If unset, the website
  will build, but no analytics will be logged. It is better to set this on
  Netlify than in this repo.
- `GATSBY_GA_BRANCH`: Corresponds to the "branch name" to use for Google
  Analytics. Only relevant if `GA_TRACKING_ID` is set.
- `GATSBY_USE_PROD_FIREBASE`: When set to `"1"`, uses the environment variables
  `GATSBY_PROD_FIREBASE_*` to configure Firebase instead of the
  `GATSBY_FIREBASE_*` variables listed in [Getting Started](#getting-started).
  **This enables writes to the production Firebase instance.**

## üß™ Testing

This project has [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) configured for unit tests and
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) for end-to-end tests. They also include visual
regression tests set up using [Percy](https://percy.io).

Cypress configuration variables:

- `SEED_URL`: Variable to use for seeding data for tests. This corresponds to
  function `seedInvitations`.

### To run the entire test suite (unit + e2e) locally

```sh
cd website
npm run test
```

### To open the Cypress app locally

```sh
cd website
npm run develop
npm run cy:open
```

## üîÑ Continuous integration

The entire test suite is also run on CI servers, using the `test:ci` NPM script.
